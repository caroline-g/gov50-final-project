## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the East Asian economy and international political economy. In particular, I'd like to investigate the diplomatic and economic impact of the K-pop industry (e.g., data related to revenue generated by the K-pop industry and related tourism, changes in international perceptions of Korea due to Hallyu, etc.).
